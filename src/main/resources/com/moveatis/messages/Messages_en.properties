inf_whatIsText=<p>Moveatis is a web-based application designed for the analysis of teaching situations. \
               The application was developed at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 jointly between the Department \
               of Sport Pedagogy and the Department of Mathematical Information Technology. This new technology \
               stemmed from work carried out in physical education teacher education, which has a long tradition \
               in the analysis of teacher behaviour in physical education. Moveatis supports the systematic \
               observation of teaching situations through its ability to record duration and frequency within \
               teaching situations. The application can be used, for example, to easily record how much time a \
               teacher spends giving instruction, how much time a student is active or how many times a teacher \
               gives feedback during a lesson. </p>\
               <p>Before using the application it is important to first decide which behaviour or content is to \
               be recorded and analyzed. Although the Moveatis application was originally designed for the analysis \
               of physical education lessons, it is suitable for analyzing a variety of learning situations as it \
               allows users to select and modify categories according to individual needs. </p>

inf_userGuideText=<p><h4>Log in and user status</h4></p> \
                  <p>The Moveatis application is initiated by selecting the appropriate user status from the home \
                  page (moveatis.sport.jyu.fi). Users can log in as University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 users or start the \
                  application using a group key or as a public user. <b><i>Public users</i></b> may use the application \
                  and almost all of its functions. They have the option to add categories and conduct observations but \
                  do not have the authorisation to save results to the application\u2019s database. <b><i>Logged-in users</i></b> \
                  are authorised to create and store events and observation categories and save information to the \
                  application\u2019s database, allowing observations to be reloaded to the application later. Users using a \
                  group key have access to category groups and observations stored under the specific group key for a \
                  given event. User using a group key also have the option to send observation results to their own \
                  email addresses.</p>\
                  <p><h4>Modifying category groups and categories</h4></p>\
                  <p>Prior to observation, the user is guided to a page where category groups and categories belonging \
                  to each category group can be added, removed and modified. Users can also select in settings whether \
                  to record the duration or frequency of given events. Users can choose to use more than one category \
                  group at the same time, for example one category group for teacher behaviour and another for student \
                  behaviour.</p>\
                  <p><h4>Carrying out/conducting observations</h4></p> \
                  <p>An observation is initiated by pressing the play button, which starts the observation clock. \
                  After this, the user records the actions or events by selecting categories. The pause button stops the \
                  clock but allows observations to continue later. The stop button stops the clock and redirects the user \
                  to the summary page.</p>\
                  <p><h4>Summary of observations</h4></p> \
                  <p>On the summary page, the frequency and/or duration of each recording is displayed. Within each \
                  category, the application displays the total duration and/or frequency as well as percentage values. In \
                  addition, a graph shows each recording on a timeline.</p>\
                  <p>There are two possibilities for saving the observation results. Results can be saved to the \
                  application\u2019s database via the save button or as a csv-file on the user\u2019s own device. In addition, \
                  logged-in users or users using a group key can send the csv-file to their email addresses to be viewed \
                  later in Excel.</p>

inf_creditsText=<p>The Moveatis project is a result of cooperation between the Department Sport Pedagogy and the Department \
                of Mathematical Information Technology at the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. Within the Department of Sport \
                Pedagogy, Professor Pilvikki Heikinaro-Johansson, Professor Mirja Hirvensalo and Nelli Lyyra contributed \
                knowledge related to analyzing teaching situations and defining the requirements for the application. \
                Within the Department of Mathematical Information Technology, Jukka-Pekka Santanen acted as corresponding \
                supervisor and Mika Lehtinen as technical supervisor. The application itself was developed by a project \
                group including Jarmo Juuj\u00e4rvi, Sami Kallio, Kai Korhonen, Juha Moisio and Ilari Paananen.</p> \
