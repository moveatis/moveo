# moveatis

Moveatis is a web-based software for making observations. It was developed in 
University of Jyväskylä, as part of student project in spring 2016. 

Moveatis runs in Java EE application server, we used Wildfly 9, a Java EE 7 
certified server in development and production. For database we used PostgreSQL. 
Main UI library is Primefaces, http://primefaces.org

Moveatis is built with Maven, so you should be able to use any IDE, that works with
Maven project files. We used Netbean 8.2.

To develop Moveatis, you need to pull this repository to your machine and install
local webserver and database, where you run the Moveatis.
